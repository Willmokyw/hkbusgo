We will take all practicable steps to ensure that your personal information is not kept longer than is necessary.</p>
                
                <h3>DATA TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE</h3>
                <p>No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
                
                <p>ZestTech Studio uses third-party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the ZestTech Service. Where practical, we seek to obtain confidentiality agreements that are consistent with this Privacy Policy and that limit others' use or disclosure of your Personal Information, but we would not disclose the agreements.</p>
                
                <h3>ACCESS AND CORRECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
                <p>Your personal information will be kept in our database for a reasonable period. If you are the subject of the personal information, you have the right to:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Check whether we hold your personal information.</li>
                    <li>Obtain a copy of such information.</li>
                    <li>Correct any related information that is inaccurate or outdated.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>You may also request to delete your personal information. However, ZestTech Studio aims to maintain our services in a manner that protects your personal information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you have deleted your personal information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and remove information from our backup systems. ZestTech Studio will remove the information you have deleted within a reasonable time if such information is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the purposes for which the information is used. If you have a request, please contact us.</p>
                
                <p>When updating or deleting your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.</p>
                
                <p>ZestTech Studio may reject requests that are:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Unreasonably repetitive.</li>
                    <li>Require disproportionate technical effort (e.g., developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice).</li>
                    <li>Risk the privacy of others.</li>
                    <li>Would be extremely impractical (e.g., requests concerning information residing on backup tapes).</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>INTERNATIONAL USE</h3>
                <p>The ZestTech Service is hosted in Hong Kong. If you use the ZestTech Service from outside of Hong Kong, you acknowledge that you are voluntarily transferring information (potentially including Personal Information) to Hong Kong and agree that ZestTech Studio's collection, use, storage, and sharing of your information is exclusively subject to the laws of Hong Kong, not of the jurisdiction in which you are located.</p>
                
                <h3>CHANGES AND UPDATES</h3>
                <p>We continue to update this Privacy Policy as a living document. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about how we are protecting the Personal Information we collect. Your continued use of the ZestTech Service constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any updates.</p>
